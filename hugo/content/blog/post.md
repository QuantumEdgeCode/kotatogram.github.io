For a long time this site was abandoned. It featured old releases, old feature list... and that's it. It was pretty much a placeholder, than something useful.

But I think it's time to give it a new look and content. So, welcome to the new site.

Instead of Jekyll, used in GitHub Pages by default, I decided to go with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and modified port of HTML5UP's Alpha theme. [See the source code](https://github.com/kotatogram/hugo-html5up-alpha) if you want to fit it for yourself.

[Original port](https://github.com/dewittn/hugo-html5up-alpha) was really good, but I've patched it for my needs:

* Improved localization support.
* Multiple fixes for top menu.
* Added `box-separator` shortcode.
* Patched some styles to my needs (also self-hosted fonts).
* Fixed scrolling to page anchor (it was under header before).
* Added Telegram comments.

And yeah, there are Telegram comments now. Feel free to comment here.

Aside of look and comments, site is now more useful. Of course, it's not complete and will be updated eventually, but currently it features more info than old one.

But site isn't only thing that needs to be updated. Just wait a little more.
