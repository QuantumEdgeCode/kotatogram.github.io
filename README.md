# Kotatogram site

This repo is intended for building and managing Kotatogram site on [kotatogram.github.io](https://kotatogram.github.io). Since `master` branch is used for building GitHub pages, I'm using `dev` branch to pre-build the site itself.

For now there is no special build process, I'm just preparing and testing.
