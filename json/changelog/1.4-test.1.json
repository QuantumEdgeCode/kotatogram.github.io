{"version": "1.4-test.1", "tdVersion": "2.7.1", "releaseDate": "2021-04-24T16:08:00+03:00", "whatToTest": "\u2022 Test branches. It's the first build with modified alpha versions from Telegram Desktop as test. Please note that in contrary to alpha versions, test builds can be updated only to test builds of corresponding branch, so it's highly discouraged to use them as main client. Also note that until next update you can see \"Update check failed\" message when checking for updates.\n\u2022 In-app changelogs. Example of it you can see right here.\n\u2022 Unquoted forward (yes, again). I changed part related to albums, so it's important to check unquoted forwarding of albums. Also it would be helpful to test updating of internal media references, i.e. open some file in chat and then forward it unquoted in a few hours without restarting the app.", "features": "\u2022 In-app changelog. Currently it's downloaded from kotatogram.github.io.", "changes": "\u2022 Reduced description font size for options with radio buttons. It was done to prevent options to go beyond the edge.\n\u2022 Removed unnecessary separator in own profile.", "fixes": "\u2022 Kotatogram's MRPIS separated from Telegram Desktop's MPRIS.\n\u2022 Fixed crash when right-clicking emoji button. Earlier it can be reproduced with emoji side bar opened and emoji panel on hover disabled.\n\u2022 Possible fix for repeating changelogs. Can't be tested in this version, only in next.\n\u2022 Top profile notification switcher not shown in own profile anymore.", "links": [{"title": "Test versions FAQ", "link": "https://kotatogram.github.io/faq/test-versions"}]}
