It featured old releases, old feature list&amp;hellip; and that&amp;rsquo;s it. It was pretty much a placeholder, than something useful.
But I think it&amp;rsquo;s time to give it a new look and content. So, welcome to the new site.
Instead of Jekyll, used in GitHub Pages by default, I decided to go with Hugo and modified port of HTML5UP&amp;rsquo;s Alpha theme. See the source code if you want to fit it for yourself.</description></item><item><title>Download Kotatogram Desktop</title><link>https://kotatogram.github.io/download/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kotatogram.github.io/download/</guid><description>Stable version Latest is 1.3.5 (based on Telegram Desktop 2.1.4) Windows Supports Windows 7 and higher.

When update? Will ghost mode/blocked users ignore be made? Will Android version be made? My anti-virus detects Kotatogram as a malware! Is it true that account can be banned because of unofficial client usage? Do you have any plans to monetize Kotatogram? When update? I&amp;rsquo;m trying not to tell exact dates, because usually I fit into them only when everything is ready.</description></item><item><title>Features</title><link>https://kotatogram.github.io/features/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kotatogram.github.io/features/</guid><description>This is the list of features that Kotatogram Desktop have at the moment.
